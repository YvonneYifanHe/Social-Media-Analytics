## Dataset Introduction
The dataset used in this project includes Amazon reviews for the pet supplies category from 2006 to 2014. There are 6,542,483 reviews and 206,141 products in the dataset. Here we conduct sentiment based on review text analysis to figure out what consumer attitudes towards dog food.

This project mainly focuses on the analysis of dog food. So, we subset the whole dataset to a dog related dataset using “dog”, “dogs”, “doggy”, “puppy”, “puppies”, “doggy”, “doggies” as key words. 

## Project Design
This project uses three methods to analyze the dogfood related Amazon reviews.
* Topic Models
* Sentiment Analysis
* Word2Vec Contextual information representation
